# ifxurls
Tools for getting urls in the ifx environment

This is currently just a function that returns hardcoded URL paths.  Application URL fetching would only change at build time.

At some future date this may be more dynamic :)

You can set "base" API URLs via environment variables if you want, e.g.

export NANITES_API_BASE='http://localhost:9876/nanites/api'
